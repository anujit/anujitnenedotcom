Hi! Trying to restart writing a blog, yet again! This time I have chosen 11ty as the framework of choice. It is a freamework similar to jekyll - which focusses more on the content and writing part of a blog than any other ceremonies. I am using the official base blog template provided by 11ty and so might switch to a different starter/theme in the future. Looking forward!
